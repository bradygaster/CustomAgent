# The Jabberwocky: A Mythical Creature of Literary Fame

## Origin and Literary Context

The Jabberwocky is a legendary creature that originated in Lewis Carroll's novel "Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There" (1871), the sequel to "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland." The creature is the subject of the nonsensical poem "Jabberwocky," which is considered one of the greatest nonsense poems written in the English language. The poem is notable for its playful, invented words and its vivid imagery.

## Physical Description

The Jabberwocky is described as a fearsome monster with "jaws that bite" and "claws that catch." It has eyes of flame and is said to "whiffle" through the "tulgey" wood. In John Tenniel's famous illustration accompanying the original text, the Jabberwocky appears as a dragon-like creature with a long neck, scales, wings, and a vest. It stands upright like a human but has the features of various reptilian and avian creatures combined.

## Cultural Impact

The term "Jabberwocky" has become synonymous with nonsensical language that seems to have meaning. Carroll's inventive linguistics in the poem introduced several words that have entered the English language, including "chortle" (a blend of chuckle and snort) and "galumph" (a triumphant gallop). The creature has been referenced and reimagined countless times in popular culture, appearing in films, television shows, games, and other literary works.

## The Poem

Here is the complete poem:

"'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves  
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;  
All mimsy were the borogoves,  
And the mome raths outgrabe.

"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!  
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!  
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun  
The frumious Bandersnatch!"

He took his vorpal sword in hand:  
Long time the manxome foe he soughtâ€”  
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,  
And stood awhile in thought.

And as in uffish thought he stood,  
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,  
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,  
And burbled as it came!

One, two! One, two! And through and through  
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!  
He left it dead, and with its head  
He went galumphing back.

"And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?  
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!  
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!"  
He chortled in his joy.

'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves  
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;  
All mimsy were the borogoves,  
And the mome raths outgrabe."

The poem tells of a young hero who is warned about the dangerous Jabberwock. Armed with a "vorpal" sword, the hero seeks out and eventually slays the beast, returning triumphantly with its head.

## Interpretations

Despite its nonsensical language, the poem follows a clear narrative structure and has been interpreted in many ways. Some see it as a classic hero's journey tale, while others view it as a commentary on Victorian-era attitudes and fears. The deliberate linguistic play invites readers to create their own meanings and interpretations, making the Jabberwocky a fascinating study in the power of language and imagination.
